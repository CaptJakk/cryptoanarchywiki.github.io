* [Discrete Mathematics: Elementary and Beyond](http://home.anadolu.edu.tr/~eakyar/dersler/ayrik/kitap/kitap.pdf) by L. Lovász, J. Pelikán, K. Vesztergombi - _Good primer on a lot of the pure mathematics involved in cryptography_
* [Introduction to Cryptography with Christof Paar (Full University Lecture Series)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1usFRN4LCMcfIV7UjHNuQg/videos) - _This lecture series is one of the best collections of introductory material relating to modern cryptography. I wholeheartedly recommend this along with its companion textbook "Understanding Cryptography" by Christoff Paar and Jan Pelzl._
    * [crypto-textbook.com](http://www.crypto-textbook.com/) - _Website for the textbook "Understanding Cryptography"_.
    * [Odd-Numbered Questions Solution Manual](http://wiki.crypto.rub.de/Buch/en/download/Understanding_Cryptography_Odd_Solutions.pdf) - The solution manual for the exercises in the textbook. However, it only contains the solution to the odd-numbered questions.
    * [All Problems and Solutions](https://tom.busby.ninja/understanding-cryptography-full-solution-set/) - A set of solutions  (not yet complete - 2018-05-27) to the problems set in the textbook, maintained by me, including even-numbered questions. Includes links to the PDFs detailing the exercises.
* [The Handbook of Applied Cryptography](http://cacr.uwaterloo.ca/hac/) by Alfred J. Menezes, Paul C. van Oorschot and Scott A. Vanstone
* [Applied Cryptography (Second Edition)](https://ia600202.us.archive.org/10/items/AppliedCryptographyBruceSchneier/Applied%20Cryptography%20%28Bruce%20Schneier%29.pdf) by Bruce Schneier - _I personally found this book fairly impenetrable, maybe try The Handbook of Applied Cryptography unless you have a strong mathematics background_
* [An Introduction to Mathematical Cryptography](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.182.9999&rep=rep1&type=pdf) by Jeffrey Hoffstein, Jill Pipher, Joseph H. Silverman
* [Elementary Cryptanalysis: A Study of Ciphers and Their Solution](http://informatika.stei.itb.ac.id/~rinaldi.munir/Kriptografi/2010-2011/cryptanalysis.pdf) by Helen Fouché Gaines - _Recommended by David Kahn in "The Codebreakers" as the best introductory book on the subject of breaking historical ciphers_
* [American Cryptogram Association Magazine](http://www.cryptogram.org/) - _Mentioned in the books "The Codebreakers" and "Crypto". Members can join from the US or overseas to receive a bi-monthy magazine of cryptograms and their solutions. Those interested in classical cryptanalysis will likely want to join this organisation to sharpen their skills_
