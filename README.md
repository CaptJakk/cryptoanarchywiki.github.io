## Basic Information

### Jekyll theme forked from:
* [agusmakmun/agusmakmun.github.io](https://github.com/agusmakmun/agusmakmun.github.io)

### Source code structure:
The site works primarily via [Jekyll Collections](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/) (collections are defined in _config.yml). The primary types are as follows:

+ **Section** - This is for items that should be displayed in the hompage contents. There is a collection for each section on the homepage. The items within the collection form the list items below the header.
+ **Subsection** - This is for content which is to be listed on a section item's page (i.e. the page of a specific instance of the collection type above). An example of this type would be the "people" collection. Some of the items in this collection would be found on the "Early Cypherpunks" page.
