His name is the origin of the cryptocurrency community slang "Zhou Tonged":

> Bitcoin Slang, Your positions are automatically liquidated due to insufficient trading balance after a margin call. This occurs when trading using "leverage buying" at high levels 5:1 or 10:1. The large swings in the Bitcoin exchange rates can force automated margin selling, when the Broker sells out the customer without notice. I Just Got "ZHOU TONGED"!.... lost it all on a margin call.

Zhou Tong presided over the Bitcoinica debacle and is a suspected scammer/thief. I'll be including a lot more about him when I do the research on the Bitcoinica collapse/theft.
