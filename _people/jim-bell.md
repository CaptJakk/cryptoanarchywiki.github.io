From wikipedia:

> James Dalton Bell (born 1958) is an American crypto-anarchist who created the idea of arranging for anonymously sponsored assassination payments via the Internet, which he called "assassination politics". Since the publication of the "Assassination Politics" essay, Bell was targeted by the federal government of the United States. He was imprisoned on felony charges of tax evasion in 1997. In 2001, Wired called Bell "[o]ne of the Internet's most famous essayists" and "the world's most notorious crypto-convict".

## Quotes about Assassination Markets

> If they continue to work for the government, they deserve it. My suggestion to these people is to quit now and hope for mercy.

> I once believed it's too bad that there are a lot of people who work for government who are hard-working and honest people who will get hit (by Assassination Politics) and it's a shame, Well, I don't believe that any more. They are all either crooks or they tolerate crooks or they are aware of crooks among their numbers.
