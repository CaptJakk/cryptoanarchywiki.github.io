From myhopeforthe.world:

> I had to put my humanitarian work on the back burner a few years ago. I couldn't make a living, not even enough to support myself in poverty. It was becoming a problem, and I was not being effective. I looked at Elon Musk, and realized there was a better way.

> I had always had profound talent for technology, and so I went back to my original trade full time, helped launch Ethereum (a >$15bn blockchain project), and now run hexayurt.capital, a VC in London. I hope one day I will get back to doing humanitarian design full time. But this time with a staff to help me realize my hope for the world.
