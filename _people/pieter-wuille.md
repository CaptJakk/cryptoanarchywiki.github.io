# Pieter Wuille

Blockstream.com team bio:

> Pieter discovered Bitcoin in November 2010 and became a member of the Bitcoin Core development team in May 2011. Since then, he has rewritten significant parts of the reference clientâ€™s code, in particular to improve performance and code organization. He wrote Bitcoin Improvement Proposals 30, 32, 42 and 62, and is the primary author of libsecp256k1, a library for efficient elliptic curve cryptography for use in Bitcoin. Before Blockstream, Pieter worked as a Site Reliability Engineer at Google. Pieter received his Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Leuven, where he focused on programming language design. He grew up in Belgium, but is currently living in Switzerland. In his free time, Pieter likes throwing discs around (not the type used to store the blockchain) and playing board games.
