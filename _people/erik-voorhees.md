From wikipedia (2018-05-28):

> Erik Tristan Voorhees is an American startup founder. He is co-founder of the bitcoin company Coinapult, worked as Director of Marketing at BitInstant, and was founder and partial owner of the bitcoin gambling website Satoshi Dice (subsequently sold in July 2013 to an undisclosed buyer).

> He was fined by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for an unregistered stock offering related to SatoshiDice.

> He is also the creator and CEO of the instant bitcoin and altcoin exchange ShapeShift.io, having founded and operated it under the alias Beorn Gonthier, until revealing his true involvement with the company, as part of a seed funding announcement, in March 2015.

> Originally from Colorado, Voorhees later moved to Dubai, Panama, New York City and New Hampshire, becoming a participant in the Free State Project.[2] According to a US court order in a SEC case, Voorhees is a US citizen as of 3 June 2014. He attended Vail Mountain School, and graduated in 2007 from the University of Puget Sound.

> Voorhees believes the current monetary system has serious systemic problems with counterparty risk, that the Federal Reserve System is "fraudulent" and advocates "the separation of money and state." He keeps his assets and finances in bitcoin and is an outspoken opponent of taxation though he does file with the IRS as an American citizen.
